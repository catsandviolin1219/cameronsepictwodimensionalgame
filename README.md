# cameronsepictwodimensionalgame
Cameron's epic two dimensional game where you jump on blocks and try to get to the exit as fast as possible. It includes features such as an encryption and decryption system for storing level data in small strings and you can also dodge spikes and change various settings for the game such as the background color, border size, height of the game, width of the game, and it will have a variety of cool features that make it overall better than everyone else's games so I think you should play this instead because everyone else's games aren't as good as this game which is so good that I would buy this for 537,135,257 USD if I had that amount of money. I can't believe this is such a good game I want to buy this game 157 times in order to support the creator of this game because they are so much better than everyone else because they make the best games and everyone else's games are inferior to this one. In conclusion get rekt nerds this game is better than all ya dumdums
